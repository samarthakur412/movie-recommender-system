# 🎬 AI Movie Recommendation System

An intelligent **content-based movie recommendation system** built using **Machine Learning, NLP, and Streamlit** that suggests movies similar to the one a user selects.

The system analyzes movie **genres, cast, keywords, director, and overview** to compute similarity between movies and recommend the most relevant ones.

🚀 **Live App:** *Add your Streamlit deployment link here*

# 📌 Project Overview

Recommendation systems power platforms like  **Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Spotify** .
This project demonstrates how such systems can be built using  **Natural Language Processing and cosine similarity** .

The model analyzes movie metadata and finds **semantic similarity** between movies to generate recommendations.

Example:

If you select  **Avatar** , the system may recommend:

* Guardians of the Galaxy
* John Carter
* Star Trek
* Jupiter Ascending
* The Fifth Element

---

# 🧠 How It Works

The recommendation pipeline follows these steps:

1️⃣ Load movie datasets
2️⃣ Merge movie and credit datasets
3️⃣ Extract important features
4️⃣ Perform text preprocessing
5️⃣ Generate movie tags
6️⃣ Convert text to vectors using **CountVectorizer**
7️⃣ Compute similarity using **Cosine Similarity**
8️⃣ Recommend top similar movies
